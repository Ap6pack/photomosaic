Urgent:
Update readme.
mosaic_size is hard coded. Infer it from tiles or something.

Functionality:
Fix "dark palette" issue.
Split tiles
Mask image: black -> no tile, gray -> probabilistic

Performance:
Fast RGB -> XYZ -> LAB using Image.convert()
memoize tile resizing

Diagnostics:
sqlite3.set_progress_handler(handler, n) # handler is called every n calls
progress() as a generator that can see in an non-enumerated loop and count to itself. try progress(len(tiles), "Message")
